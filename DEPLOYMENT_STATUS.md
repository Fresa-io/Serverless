### ❌ Missing Functions

- `testFunction` - Not deployed
- `veriftAuthChallenge` - Not deployed

## 🔧 Next Steps

### 1. Update GitHub Actions Secrets

Go to your GitHub repository → **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**

Update these secrets:

```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = your-access-key-here
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = your-secret-key-here
```

### 2. Deploy Missing Functions

The missing functions need to be deployed. You can either:

**Option A: Use CDK (Recommended)**

```bash
cd /Users/luissantiago/Serverless
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your-access-key-here"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your-secret-key-here"
export AWS_REGION="us-east-1"

# Deploy with CDK
cdk deploy
```

**Option B: Use GitHub Actions**

1. Push your changes to trigger the pipeline
2. The pipeline will automatically deploy missing functions

### 3. Configure Aliases

Your functions are deployed but don't have STAGING/PROD aliases configured. This is because the current user doesn't have alias management permissions.

**To fix this, you need to:**

1. Grant the user `lambda:CreateAlias` and `lambda:UpdateAlias` permissions
2. Or use a different AWS user/role with full Lambda permissions

### 4. Test the Pipeline

Once secrets are updated:

1. Make a small change to any function
2. Push to main branch
3. Check GitHub Actions to see the deployment

## 🔐 Security Notes

✅ **Removed all references to previous AWS account**  
✅ **Updated all configuration files**  
✅ **Using your new AWS credentials**  
✅ **No sensitive data exposed**

## 📊 Current Configuration

- **Account ID:** Auto-detected from AWS credentials
- **Region:** Auto-detected from AWS_REGION environment variable
- **Repository:** luissantiago/Serverless
- **Stack Name:** FresaLambdaStack

## 🎯 What's Working

1. ✅ Lambda functions are deployed and active
2. ✅ GitHub Actions pipeline is configured
3. ✅ CDK stack is ready for deployment
4. ✅ All scripts use your new AWS credentials
5. ✅ No references to previous account

## ⚠️ What Needs Attention

1. 🔧 Update GitHub Actions secrets
2. 🔧 Deploy missing functions (testFunction, veriftAuthChallenge)
3. 🔧 Configure IAM permissions for alias management
4. 🔧 Test the complete deployment pipeline

## 🚀 Ready to Deploy!

Your Lambda functions are successfully deployed in your new AWS account. The deployment pipeline is ready to use your new credentials.
